# Minesweeper

Welcome to MySweeper!  

This game is a loving remake of the mid-90s classic puzzle game.

The goal of the game is to mark all of the "bomb" tiles, and reveal every other tile on the board.  

There are 40 bombs on the 20 x 20 grid.  

Each numbered tile represents the amount of adjacent bomb tiles (diagonals included), while each empty tiles indicates no adjacent bombs.  

Left click on a tile to reveal it, or use space to mark/unmark potential bomb tiles with a flag.  

Once all forty bombs are marked, and there are no covered tiles, you win the game!  

Click on a bomb tile, however...

Use this information, and your wits, to determine which tiles are rigged. Watch your step!
